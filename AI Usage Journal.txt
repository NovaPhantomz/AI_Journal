Week 1 (Sept 1–14, 2025)
x
This week I used AI to help me understand how to set up Python and Jupyter on my Mac. It explained why .ipynb files don’t run like .py files and showed me how to install Jupyter. I also asked about VS Code extensions for working with notebooks. These chats helped me get my environment ready for class.

Week 2 (Sept 15–21, 2025)
This week I used AI to go over the Library Management project exercises for INST326. It walked me through how to use lists, conditionals, and loops without functions, and gave me full worked out solutions so I could check my work. I also asked about fixing an “authors not defined” error and learned why I needed to re declare the starter data. These chats helped me practice the basics and feel more confident before moving on to Week 3 topics.

Week 3 (Sept 22–28, 2025) 

This week I used AI while working on my INST326 Week 3 function exercises. I mainly relied on it to help with debugging and formatting issues when my code wasn’t running the way I expected. It pointed out errors in my logic and showed me clearer ways to structure my functions so they were easier to test and read.  

Week 4 (Sept 29–Oct 5, 2025)

This week’s assignment focused on classes and objects for the Library Management Project. I used AI to better understand how __init__ works and how to design methods that modify instance attributes. It helped me write short, clean class definitions and made sure I avoided using features like inheritance or decorators that we haven’t learned yet. I also used it to double check my syntax for instance methods and to verify that my class tests ran correctly in Jupyter. 

Week 5 (Oct 6–12, 2025)
This week’s assignment focused on encapsulation and data hiding in the Library Management Project. I used AI to help me write classes with private and protected attributes, along with getters, setters, and simple validation. It helped me check that I was following the Week 5 scope and not using features like inheritance or advanced error handling. I also used AI to review my code structure and make sure my properties worked correctly for each exercise in the notebook.

Week 4 (Oct 6–12, 2025)
This week I used ChatGPT to help me build and test my Pet Care Function Library for INST326 Project 01. It helped me write clean Python functions, structure my GitHub repository, and understand how to use Git commands like add, commit, and push. I learned how to organize my files using folders like src, docs, and examples, and how to run my code in GitHub Codespaces. The AI was really helpful for writing docstrings and debugging small issues, but I still tested and verified everything myself to make sure I understood how it all worked.

Week 5 (Oct 6–12, 2025)
This week I worked on encapsulation and data hiding. AI helped me write classes with private attributes and simple getters and setters. It reminded me to keep my solutions within the Week 5 scope (no advanced error handling). It also helped me verify that my class behavior was correct by running tests.

Week 6 (Oct 13–19, 2025)
This week I built my Pet Care Function Library for Project 01. I used AI to help me design clear function names, write docstrings, and format output. It helped me understand how to organize my project folder with directories like src, docs, and examples. It also guided me through basic Git commands, like add, commit, and push, so I could keep my code versioned properly.

Week 7 (Oct 20–26, 2025)
This week focused on error handling and simple testing. AI helped me understand try, except, else, and finally, along with raising my own exceptions. I used it to practice writing unit tests with unittest and to make sure I was only using features we covered so far. It helped me see how testing and error handling could catch mistakes before they break the program.

Week 8 (Oct 27–Nov 2, 2025)
This week we worked on inheritance and polymorphism in the Library Management project. I used AI to help me understand how subclassing works and how to override methods using super(). It helped me see the difference between reuse through inheritance versus reuse through composition. I still wrote and tested the subclass methods myself, but the explanations helped me understand why inheritance made sense in this part of the project.

Week 9 (Nov 3-9, 2025)
This week we learned about abstract classes and interfaces. I used AI to help me understand how abstract methods and properties work, and why Python gives a TypeError if you forget to implement one. It also helped me figure out virtual subclasses and the difference between ABCs and Protocols. I mainly used it to double check my code and fix small mistakes, but I still wrote and tested everything myself.

Week 10 (Nov 10–16, 2025)
This week I worked on Project 03, which focused on inheritance, polymorphism, and composition. I used AI to help me design an abstract Pet class and create subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird that each override behavior in different ways. It also helped me understand when to use composition, like how an Owner has pets and a Tracker manages owners. I got a lot of debugging help when my imports weren’t working in Codespaces and when my schedule logic caused failing tests. AI also guided me through writing unit tests for inheritance, polymorphism, schedule behavior, and composition. Even though the AI helped me solve issues faster, I still ran and verified all the tests myself to make sure the code worked the way I intended.

Week 11 (Nov 17–23, 2025)
This week I used AI to help me with some of the early refactoring work for Project 04 in INST326. I asked it to review parts of my Pet Care Tracker code where I was repeating the same logic across multiple methods, and it showed me how to rewrite those sections using cleaner class methods without going outside the scope of what we learned. I also used it to help debug an issue where two of my files were importing each other and causing a circular import error in Codespaces. AI explained why that happens and suggested reorganizing one of the classes into a shared module, which fixed the problem. It also helped me write clearer docstrings and come up with a few test cases to check edge behaviors, like when a pet has no tasks logged. Overall, AI helped me understand my design decisions better and made the refactoring process smoother.

Week 12 (Nov 24–30, 2025)
This week I used AI while continuing work on Project 04 for INST326, focusing on integration and testing. I used it to help me think through how different parts of my Pet Care Tracker system interacted with each other, especially owners, pets, and care tasks. AI helped me identify missing edge cases and suggest realistic test scenarios, such as checking behavior when no pets exist for an owner or when tasks are overdue. I also used it to help write and organize my testing documentation so that it clearly explained what was being tested and why. This made my testing more structured and easier to follow.

Week 13 (Dec 1–14, 2025)
This week I used AI to help with several parts of finalizing and submitting Project 04. I used it to review my full script and confirm that it met the project requirements and stayed within the scope of the course. It helped me double check that I was demonstrating object oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition correctly throughout the system. I also used AI to assist with writing my final documentation files, including the project overview and testing documentation, and to verify that my GitHub repository was organized properly before submission. In addition, AI helped troubleshoot last minute issues in Codespaces, such as import errors and failing tests. Overall, it helped streamline the final submission process while still requiring me to understand and verify all of my work.
